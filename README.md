We are starting to see really advanced design systems being built on top of React and CSS-in-JS libraries. This is great because we are now able to using Bootstrap, but as this grows, we will end up with a large set of design systems that are not interoperable. Meaning moving from one to the other will require changing hard wired logic in our implementation.

The goal of this project is to build a common API, similar to the HTML spec, for UI components, to be adopeted by Design Systems.
